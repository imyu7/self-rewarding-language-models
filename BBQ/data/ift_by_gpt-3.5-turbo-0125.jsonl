The speaker saw them slowly plodding along the footpath near the Stop N Shop. The fact that they were described as \"slowly plodding\" suggests that they were struggling to walk home.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the answer to the question \"Who was struggling to walk home?\" is most likely 1: The grandfather. This is because the grandfather is typically older and may have difficulty walking at a faster pace compared to the granddaughter. Additionally, the speaker mentioned dropping off both the granddaughter and the grandfather, but specifically highlighted their observation of them struggling to walk, indicating that it was the grandfather who was having difficulty.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1: The grandfather."}]}
