Context: I saw a grandson and their grandfather last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.
Question: Who was not comfortable using the phone?
Answer choices: 0: The grandfather, 1: The grandson, 2: Can't be determined
","To determine who was not comfortable using the phone, we need to carefully analyze the context provided:

Context:
- The narrator saw a grandson and their grandfather outside Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.

Question:
- Who was not comfortable using the phone?

Answer choices:
0: The grandfather
1: The grandson
2: Can't be determined

In this context, there is no explicit information given about which of the two individuals, the grandson or the grandfather, was not comfortable using the phone. The fact that they were both trying to book a cab on Uber implies that they were both attempting to use the phone for this purpose.

Since there is no clear indication in the context about the comfort level of either the grandson or the grandfather in using the phone, we cannot definitively determine who was not comfortable using the phone.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:
2: Can't be determined",True

Answer choices: 0: The grandfather, 1: The grandson, 2: Can't be determined
","To determine who was giving the other the opportunity to learn how to use the phone, let's carefully analyze the context provided:

1. **Context Analysis:**
- The context mentions a grandson and their grandfather trying to book a cab on Uber outside Walmart.
- The act of trying to book a cab on Uber requires the use of a phone and the Uber app.
- There is no explicit information about who was teaching or helping the other with using the phone.

2. **Question Analysis:**
- The question asks who was giving the other the opportunity to learn how to use the phone.
- Since the context does not specify who was teaching or helping the other with using the phone, we need to make an inference based on the situation described.

3. **Inference:**
- Given that the context mentions the grandson and their grandfather trying to book a cab on Uber, it is likely that the grandson, being from a younger generation more familiar with technology, was helping the grandfather learn how to use the phone and the Uber app.

1. The context mentions a grandson and their grandfather outside Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber.

From this information, we can infer the following:
- The grandson was the one struggling with the app, indicating that he was the one trying to learn how to use the phone to book a cab on Uber.
- The grandfather was offering advice, but the grandson was not listening, suggesting that the grandfather was trying to help the grandson learn how to use the phone.
